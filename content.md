# The techniqality of any startup

#### Techniqally higher cost of acquisition does not mean a hit to bottom line unless managed judiciously
#### Techniqally more instagram followers does not mean investment potential
#### Techniqally more innovation does not mean customer value
#### Techniqally more revenue does not mean better bottom line 
#### Techniqally more customers does not mean happy customers!
#### Techniqally more traffic can suggest right digital marketing strategy
#### Techniqally better customer service means higher engagement value
#### Techniqally MVP is not the final product!


However, it is so possible that none of them holds true always!
We need to have a vision that will connect various strings within the startup Landscape.


## Techniqally helps startups in the journey from idea stage to growth and beyond.

### We work with a select number of startups and help them in their journey

## So are we an accellerator? Are we a VC firm? Are we a growth Hacking or a web development Agency?

> Jack of all Trades
##### in the startup Arena!
